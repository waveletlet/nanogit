# nanogit - A lightweight git server with simple setup and configuration

**HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

## Introduction

`nanogit` is a small server to manage git projects.

It has following features:

- Organizations to group repositories and manage rights(read/write) **in development**
- Teams, a group of users in an organization **in development**
- Entire config in one file, in a human readable format ([YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))

## Install

### From `go get`

```
$ go get github.com/dgellow/nanogit
```

## Usage

```
$ nanogit server

# If you want to use a different config file
$ nanogit server --config /path/to/custom/configfile.yml

# When the server is running you can begin to use git commands
$ git clone git@localhost:1337/MyOrg/myproject.git
```

## Configuration

Server and access settings are configured in a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file. The default one is `config.yml` at the root of the project.

```yaml
server:
  dataroot: ./dataroot
  user: nanogit
  group: nanogit
